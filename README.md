<!-- # Laravel React MongoDB Blog App

An example Blog App built with Laravel, React and MongoDB. It includes:

-   An auth API, using [tymon/jwt-auth](https://github.com/tymondesigns/jwt-auth) to manage the JSON Web Tokens.
-   Routing with react-router (private, public and split routes).
-   A base ApiController to help return.
-   Bootstrap for styling.

Use it as a base for quick prototypes or to learn from. Suggestions, recommendations, and pull requests welcome!

(Password resets will not be sent from this server. Data will be cleared on a regular basis.)

## Development Environment

The backend built with Laravel. The frontend is 100% React.

Database MongoDB.

## BD

_If you don't have MongoDB installed, [instructions here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)._

_If you need to connfig MongoDB for PHP, [instructions here](https://www.php.net/manual/es/mongodb.setup.php)._

## Set Up

#### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielhdz23/blog-laravel-react-mongodb.git
```

#### Create your environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

_The app key is used to salt passwords. If you need to work with production data you'll want to use the same app key as defined in the .env file in production so password hashes match._

#### Update these settings in the .env file:

-   DB_DATABASE (your local database, i.e. "todo")
-   DB_USERNAME (your local db username, i.e. "root")
-   DB_PASSWORD (your local db password, i.e. "")
-   HASHIDS_SALT (use the app key or match the variable used in production)

#### Install PHP dependencies:

```bash
composer update
```

```bash
composer install
```

_If you don't have Composer installed, [instructions here](https://getcomposer.org/)._

#### Generate an app key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

#### Generate JWT keys for the .env file:

```bash
php artisan jwt:secret
```

#### Run the database migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

#### Install Javascript dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

_If you don't have Node and NPM installed, [instructions here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)._

#### Run an initial build:

```bash
npm run dev
```

```bash
php artisan serve
```

### Additional Set Up Tips

#### Database Seeding

If you need sample data to work with, you can seed the database:

```
php artisan migrate:refresh --seed --force
```

#### Seeded User

After seeding the database, you can log in with these credentials:

Email: `user@test.dev`
Password: `password`

#### Email Driver

Laravel sends emails for password resets. The default for MAIL_DRIVER in .env.example is log. You can view logged emails in storage/logs/laravel.log.
